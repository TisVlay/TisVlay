//! The release check each client runs against its service. A published
//! SDK talks only to services of its own release line (the same
//! `major.minor`, see [`tisvlay_protocol::compatible`]); the frozen `info`
//! rpc tells it the service's release before anything else is decoded.
//!
//! The answer holds for one lifetime of the service: it's cleared when
//! the service's liveliness token goes away, so a service restarted on
//! another release (a package upgrade under a running client) is checked
//! again. Within a lifetime the client keeps the whole `info` reply, so
//! its release and state path are mirror reads.
