//! The key router: what the shell's key handling asks Rust for, and
//! what Rust watches on its behalf.
//!
//! Slint offers no "focus next" call, in `.slint` or in Rust, so Up and
//! Down synthesize a Tab or Backtab through the window and let Slint's
//! own traversal move focus. The dispatch is synchronous and nested in
//! the arrow key's handler; `Nav.synthesizing` marks it so the shell's
//! own Tab handling (couch mode's pane cycle) lets it through.
//!
//! The detail panes navigate by rows (docs/gui/remote-navigation.md):
//! every stop reports the row it sits in as it takes focus, and a row
//! step is a walk along the Tab order until the row changes, undone
//! when the column changes instead (the order wrapped out of the
//! detail), so the detail stops at its ends. The traversal already
//! skips what's disabled or hidden and scrolls the landing into view.
//!
//! Slint also runs no handler at all once the focused item is gone, so
//! a remote's keys would go dead after a pane switch or a refresh that
//! destroyed the focused control. The shell counts every key its capture
//! handler sees; the winit hook notes the count before a navigation key
//! and checks it after the dispatch, and a key that didn't move it asks
//! the shell to restore focus to its last column.
